/// Storage is the main data type managed by the server.  It currently provides
/// access to two concurrent maps.  The first is an authentication table.  The
/// authentication table holds user names and hashed passwords, as well as a
/// single content object per user.  The second is a key/value store that can be
/// accessed by all threads.
///
/// The public interface of Storage provides functions that correspond 1:1 with
/// the data requests that a client can make.  In that manner, the server
/// command handlers need only parse a request, send its parts to the Storage
/// object, and then format and return the result.
///
/// Storage is a persistent object.  Persistence can be achieved by writing the
/// entire object to disk in response to SAV messages.  In addition, any
/// successful server_cmd_reg, server_cmd_set, server_cmd_kvi, server_cmd_kvu,
/// or server_cmd_kvd operation will write a "DIFF" entry to the file.  Note
/// that the file will be open at all times, so that these operations can
/// perform an fwrite followed by an fflush.  The file should only open and
/// close in response to load() and persist() calls.
///
/// We use a relatively simple binary wire format to write every Auth table
/// entry and every K/V pair to disk:
///
///  - Authentication entry format:
///    - Magic 8-byte constant AUTHAUTH
///    - 4-byte binary write of the length of the username
///    - Binary write of the bytes of the username
///    - Binary write of the length of pass_hash
///    - Binary write of the bytes of pass_hash
///    - Binary write of num_bytes
///    - If num_bytes > 0, a binary write of the bytes field
///  - K/V entry format:
///    - Magic 8-byte constant KVKVKVKV
///    - 4-byte binary write of the length of the key
///    - Binary write of the bytes of the key
///    - Binary write of the length of value
///    - Binary write of the bytes of value
///
/// We also have the following DIFF entries in the file:
///
/// - AUTHDIFF: when a user's content changes in the Auth table
///   - Magic 8-byte constant AUTHDIFF
///   - 4-byte binary write of the length of the username
///   - Binary write of the bytes of the username
///   - Binary write of num_bytes of the content
///   - If num_bytes > 0, a binary write of the bytes field
/// - KVUPDATE: when a key's value is changed via upsert
///   - Magic 8-byte constant KVUPDATE
///    - 4-byte binary write of the length of the key
///    - Binary write of the bytes of the key
///    - Binary write of the length of value
///    - Binary write of the bytes of value
/// - KVDELETE: when a key is removed from the key/value store
///   - Magic 8-byte constant KVDELETE
///    - 4-byte binary write of the length of the key
///    - Binary write of the bytes of the key
///
/// Note that there are other operations that need to incrementally persist
/// by adding to the file, but they do not need DIFF messages... they can use
/// AUTHAUTH and KVKVKVKV.
