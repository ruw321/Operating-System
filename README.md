This is a semester-long project about operating system. This project covers a variety of topics in OS including persistance, concurrency, virtualization, resource management and security. 

Each folder is a phase of the project that addresses one or more topics that I mentioned above. The instructions file explains what is achieved in details. You can check if your answers met all the requirements for the first phase by runnning:
python3 tests/p1.py 

Since the entire project was done in docker, so I have a rundev.sh script to start up my docker, you can do it with this command:
./rundev.sh
or
sh rundev.sh
